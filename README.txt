Last week, Julia set up the boards and things and created an AI that could play.
Then James modied the AI to have a heuristic and minimax.

This week, both of us went on wild goose chases to think of better algorithms.
We ended up on the PVS algorithm.

We were going to try the Alpha-Beta pruning, but we decided PVS was better. So
that is what we went with.
