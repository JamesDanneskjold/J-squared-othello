Last week, Julia set up the boards and things and created an AI that could play.
Then James modified the AI to have a heuristic and minimax.

This week, both of us went on wild goose chases to think of better algorithms.
We ended up on the PVS algorithm.  James has tried to implement it, with Julia
hopelessly wondeering how to help at the the same time without messing up the
Git.

We decided PVS seemed good. So that is what we went with.  However, it doesn't
seem to have worked.  We aren't winning very much.  :(
